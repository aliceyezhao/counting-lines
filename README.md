# Counting lines in text files | Python
Useful in determining the length and size of source code. Input your file name or directory name and get:

- its size

- number of files

- number of lines

- number of empty lines

- number of comment lines

Files from sub-directories will be extracted.
Text files written in the following languages are supported: Python, Java, CSS, C, C++, C Shell, HTML, Ruby. Sub-totals for every category will be given for each language. More lanugages may be supported in the future.
Non-text files, such as images, will be categorized as "Other" and will not be included in line counts.
